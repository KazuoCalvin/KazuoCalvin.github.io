I am a 3rd year Engineering Physics student at the University of British Colombia with a strong interest in condensed matter physics. I am currently part of a research group at [Stewart Blusson Quantum Matter Institute](https://qmi.ubc.ca/), working under [Dr. Joshua Folk](https://qmi.ubc.ca/team-member/joshua-folk/?team-category=investigators).
